while loading account we should need initial balance?


I created two tables in db amount and transfer

	amount			|			transfer 
					|
acc_num				|		trans_id
acc-bal				|		date n time
					|		amount
					|		credit r debit
					|		balance

Is there any foreign key to get a common relation between tables?



Note: (I will change table name amount to account)
