I wrote money-transfer-system application java code

------------------transfer-------------------------
In that
	-> I added exception (InvalidAccountDetailsException)
	
	
	-> account repository (it handles loading account number, to credit/debit and to update account balance)
	
	
	-> transfer service (it handles transfer amount from one account to other)
	



----------------------db---------------------------
In that
	-> I added connection to db
	
	
	-> entity of amount table and transfer table
	
	
	-> repository (it handles inserting account and updating account, it handles inserting transfer transactions)
